0. Nginx likes port 80
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)

Debug an issue preventing Nginx installation on an Ubuntu container from listening on port 80. Write a Bash script to automate the fix, ensuring that Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all server's active IPv4 IPs.

Requirements:

Nginx must be running and listening on port 80 of all the serverâ€™s active IPv4 IPs
Write a Bash script to configure the server to meet the above requirements
1. Make it sweet and short
